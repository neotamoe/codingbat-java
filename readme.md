# CodingBat

CodingBat is a website with a wide variety of code exercises designed by a computer
science instructor teaching people learning to code.  Specifically, these exercises
are done in Java.  Exercises are done in the built-in editor that saves, runs, and
compiles the code and then checks against tests.  I copied my code to separate files to push to github.  These files have not been compiled.
